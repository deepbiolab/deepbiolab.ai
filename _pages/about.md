    "Focused, hard work is the real key to success. Keep your eyes on the goal, and just keep taking the next step towards completing it. 
    If you aren't sure which way to do something, do it both ways and see which works better.
     
    â€” John Carmack"

<strong>`Hi, I'm Tim`</strong>. As an independent developer, I use this blog to document my explorations in the world of AI and science. 
With years of experience in [AI for science](https://ai4sciencecommunity.github.io/), including my previous role as a AI Researcher at [WuXi Biologics](https://www.wuxibiologics.com/), 
I continually push the boundaries of what's possible in biology and AI.

In addition to my work, I'm building this personal platform, <strong>`DeepBioLab`</strong>, where I share my insights into AI-driven biology, 
while constantly experimenting with new technologies like Reinforcement Learning and Large Language Models.
This platform serves as a hub for my projects, research, and ongoing exploration in the fields of AI and biology.

You can reach me best via Email or GitHub for collaboration and inquiries. **Don't miss out! Subscribe to my blog below to stay updated on my latest projects and research.**
